## About

`@ntegral/nestjs-opentok` implements a module, `OpenTokModule`, which when imported into
your nestjs project provides a OpenTok client to any class that injects it. This
lets OpenTok be worked into your dependency injection workflow without having to
do any extra work outside of the initial setup.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @ntegral/nestjs-opentok
```
